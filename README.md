<!-- INSTALLATION -->
## Usage

To have this app on your pc, you need to:
* have Ruby & Ruby on Rails installed in your computer [setup](https://github.com/lewagon/setup)
* clone this repo:
  - Clone with SSH:
  ```
    git@github.com:SantiLl/rails-challenge.git
  ```
  - Clone with HTTPS
  ```
    https://github.com/SantiLl/rails-challenge.git
  ```
* and open the terminal inside the repo and run the bundler
  - ```$ bundler install```
* run yarn in order to install all the javascript packages
  - ```$ yarn install```
* then, run rails db:migrate. This creates the database with the corresponding tables, columns and associations
  - ```$ rails db:migrate```
* then, run rails s. This will start the server at localhost `http://127.0.0.1:3000/`
  - ```$ rails s```
* and finally, you can test it in the console by running
  - ```$ rails console```

## App Interaction

Once the app structure is done run:
* `rails db:seed` in order to get all the data structure.
* `rake cryptocurrencies:update_prices` can be runned whenever prices need to be updated. If you want to automate this process, thanks to [whenever gem](https://github.com/javan/whenever), by running `crontab -r && whenever --update-crontab --set environment='development'` on the project folder. Prices now should update every 5 minutes.

### User Credentials:

Once runned the seed, you can log in with
`email: defiant@mail.com`
`password: 123456`

<!-- AUTOMATED TEST -->
### Automated Test

To run all the test enviroment run in the same folder of the app:
```bash
rspec
```
